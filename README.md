The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze driving scenarios and user attributes collected from an e-commerce website. By accurately predicting whether users will accept coupons during their journeys, the aim is to optimize coupon distribution strategies and enhance user engagement with the platform's offerings. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the userâ€™s destination,  weather, passenger, coupon attributes, user attributes, and contextual attributes, and then asks the user whether he/she will accept the coupon or not.
